# Title: Pet4Lyfe, A New Pet Matching App!

# Description:
Like most adoption agencies finding a pet a home are often hard. With Pet4Lyfe I wanted to help users search for the perfect furry friend. Based on the Owner/Seeker's preference, They can swipe through pet profiles and click on them for more information on the animal. If the user is still interested in adopting then they will be able to inquire more about the process by filling out a form on our adoption page. 

# Technologies Used:
React (Front-end)
Ruby on Rails (Back-end)
